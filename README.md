Hi, I'm Aman! I'm a student at USC interested in civics, policy, effective altruism, philosophy, neuroscience, AI, and everything else under the sun. 
I think building good governance structures is the most critical task we humans face, and I'm excited to be part of that endeavor. 

You'll find my attempts at contributing to it here!
